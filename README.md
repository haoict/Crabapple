The Crabapple framework is a library for building iOS tweaks in the Rust programming language. Normally this is done in Objective-C, or perhaps Swift, but now it is possible in Rust!

**This is very experimental. There _WILL_ be breaking changes. Use at your own risk. Please do report any issues, though.**

If you have any questions, join our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/QHkCkRP)!
## Requirements
 - [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
 - Nightly [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (minimum `1.46.0-nightly (50fc24d8a 2020-06-25)` or any build that includes commit [56e115a](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/56e115a2627ba8bdd2e66c759457af96b2b0286a))
   - Ensure the `aarch64-apple-ios` target is installed, by doing `rustup target add --toolchain nightly aarch64-apple-ios`
 - [DragonBuild](https://github.com/DragonBuild/DragonBuild) or [Theos](https://github.com/theos/theos)
   - The `DRAGONBUILD`/`THEOS` environmental variable must be set.
   - You may also point to the iOS SDK and CydiaSubstrate.framework manually.

## Examples

Multiple examples can be found in the [crabapple-example crate](src/crabapple-example/lib.rs).

### Example tweak that makes the home screen dock invisible
```rs
use crabapple::{hook_it, init_hooks};

hook_it! {
	mod dock_example {
		imports {
			use crabapple::deps::objc::runtime::*;
			use std::os::raw::c_double;
		}
		#[hook(class = "SBDockView", sel = "setBackgroundAlpha:")]
		fn setBackgroundAlpha(orig, this: &Object, cmd: Sel, alpha: c_double) [] {
			crabapple::logging::log(&format!("Crabapple dock_example | {:#?} - {:#?} - {:#?}", this, cmd, alpha));
			orig(this, cmd, 0.0);
		}
	}
}

init_hooks!(dock_example);
```
